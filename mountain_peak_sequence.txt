mountain peak sequence

check if permutations  of the numbers have a mountain peak

for 1 - > 0
for 12 -> 0
for 123 =132, 231 -> 2
for 4 = 

************

1

1, where to place 2?
12 or 21
at ends so 0

12, now where to add 3?
after 2 or before 2 that's it
123, 132
132 and reverse 231 so 2

for these 2,
 
2*2+2 = 6 fo 4
123 -> 1243 
for 3's
132 ->
1432, 1342
231 ->
2431, 2341
so, here 3*2 = 6


2^(n-1) - 2
