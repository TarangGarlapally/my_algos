n = 10

means
coins of denominations 1,2,3.....10

for 4->1,2,4
for 5->1,2,4
..
for 8-10->1,2,4,8
consider all coins which are powers of 2
log(n) + 1

this is using  bits
for 4-7
4 = 100 (in binary)
we can set any bits in it to form 'n'
those set bits will be the combinations
like
4 2 1
1 0 0

if you make it 1->1
010->2
011->3
..
111->7
